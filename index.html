            <p>I am Steven Jones. This site was created to introduce myself (Hello World!) and to showcase what I have learned and what I have used to procure the knowledge garnered in the University of Arizona Coding Program. In the top nav bar you will see that I have a dropdown that contains links to my Github and LinkedIn profiles as well as a link to my resume and the subsequent pages of the assignment.
            </p>
            <p>I am from Colorado and haven't been in Arizona long at all. My wife Moriah, son Steven, and dog Penny moved out here a short time ago. I enjoy playing and watching ice hockey, practicing and watching MMA, most things art related as well as most things technology related. I feel thankful to be at my current station in life and hope I am aware enough to live the journey that I am on and truly enjoy it.

                <p class="card-text">better known as HTML, represents the bottom most structure of code, very similar to a skeleton.

Specifically, the JavaScript for beginners videos by EJ Media; who also has other tutorials centered around coding and learning the specifics of a language.
